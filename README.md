ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryan Camp!
I'm a software engineer, a humble leader, and have a creative spirit.
I'm also a poet, researcher, and love deep-dive debugging sessions.
I'm always curious, yet focused, driven, and have been an entrepreneur since high school.
I've been in the Financial Services industry for 25+ years and have built everything from 
entire trading systems, backtesters, to HFT machine-learning algorithms. I love it.
Recently, in my spare time, I've been hard at work on a computational neuroscience model.
The model is at the stage where a single neuron is processing inputs, deciding when it's
time to fire an action potential, slowing due to aging and lack of use, and much more.
I'm fascinated by the inner-workings of the brain, and the information available is endless.
