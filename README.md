- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryan Camp!
My interests have been related to Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Low-Latency programming.
But Iâ€™m also fascinated by Neuroscience, and how to model specific areas of the brain.
Iâ€™m looking to learn and collaborate on projects within this field, specifically the EEG and MRI.
