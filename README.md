ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryan Camp!
I'm a creative individual, especially when it comes to computer programming.
Especially, when trying to find patterns and solutions to very challenging problems.
My interests have largely been limited to Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Low-Latency.
But Iâ€™ve developed a fascination with Neuroscience, and how to model specific areas of the brain.
Iâ€™m looking to learn and collaborate on projects within this field, specifically the EEG and MRI.
