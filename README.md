ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryan Camp!
I'm a software engineer, always curious, yet focused, and a humble leader.
Writing, both creative and technical, has always been a passion of mine, 
so you'll usually find my name somewhere on a Wiki page. 
I love being involved in deep-dive debugging and finding lurking bugs.
My interests are generally related to Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
But I've developed a fascination with Neuroscience, and modeling the brian.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects within this field, specifically the EEG.
