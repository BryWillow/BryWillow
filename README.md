ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryan Camp!
I'm a software engineer, a problem solver, a destructor and constructor. Clever, huh?
But seriously, I'm a leader, yet humble, a listener, and a communicator.
I gravitate toward deep-dive debugging, problem-solving, and am good at finding creative solutions on the fly.
My interests have largely been limited to Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Low-Latency.
But Iâ€™ve developed a fascination with Neuroscience, and how to model specific areas of the brain.
Iâ€™m looking to learn and collaborate on projects within this field, specifically the EEG and MRI.
