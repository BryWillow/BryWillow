ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryan Camp!
I'm a software engineer, and a humble leader. I'm always curious, yet focused.
Writing, both creative and technical, has always been a passion of mine, 
so you'll usually find my name somewhere on a Wiki page. 
I love being involved in deep-dive debugging and finding impossible bugs.
My interests are generally Machine Learning, Neural Networks, FinTech, and HFT.
I've recently developed a fascination with Computational Neuroscience, and modeling the brain.
And Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects within this field, specifically the EEG.
